# Using SQL with Jupyter Notebooks: Analyzing CIA Factbook World Population Data.

## Introduction
In this project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like the following:
- population — the global population.
- population_growth — the annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
- area — the total land and water area.

In this project, we'll use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from this database. 

In this repository you will find two files:

- factbook.db - with the database
- Using_SQL_With_Jupyter_Notebooks.ipynb - with the Notebook that contains all project details
